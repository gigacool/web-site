      <h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>
<p>I am Cédric HARTLAND, Ph.D. in computer science, husband and proud father. I currently work as a R&amp;D software engineer - front-end architect.</p>
<p>You will not find much on these pages other than: my past research interests and publications, some personal projects and a few links I consider of interests. Feel free to contact as long as it is not about doing your programming home works.</p>
<h2 id="software-engineering">Software Engineering</h2>
<p>Since September 2010, I evolve into the software engineering domain within a software editor company. I have been learning a lot about software engineering, methodologies and architectures. I have been working on various projects in exploitation part of our product.</p>
<p>Such projects require evolving at different scales, from complex product long term range work to concrete simple short term tasks. Methodological approach tends to prove quite critical, especially when working with larger teams.</p>
<h2 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<h3 id="serenna-neural-network-library">Serenna neural network library</h3>
<p>I recently started yet another neural network library. The focus is given on usability, with a concise API and a “I hope” well designed architecture. Future developments involve a user friendly neural network manipulation graphical user interface and a model driven language description for networks handling. The library Is written in Java and is available from google code.</p>
<h3 id="general-ai">General AI</h3>
<p>I have spent quite some time practicing various aspects of Artificial Intelligence. While the &quot;artificial&quot; intelligence is often far from being reached by computer programs, the actual intelligence put within is often quite remarkable.</p>
<p>With time, I plan on sharing thoughts, learning resources and computer based projects with regard to typical or less typical artificial intelligence projects. Keep in touch.</p>
<h3 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h3>
<p>Even though I am not looking for a job, I am still open to challenges and opportunities. Feel free to consult my curriculum and contact me ([English], [Français]). I am open in terms of positions and locations around the world.</p>
